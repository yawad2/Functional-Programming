Functional Programming:

This repository contains my implementation of a functional programming project. The project involves creating various functions in Lisp that operate on lists, sets, and perform mathematical computations. 

Project Overview

List Functions
These functions operate on lists and include tasks such as computing the length of a list, appending two lists, and performing right folds.

Set Functions
Set functions deal with sets represented as lists. They include functions to check if an element is in a set, determine if two sets are equal, find the difference between two sets, and check if one set is a subset of another.

Math Functions
Math functions involve mathematical computations, such as finding the absolute value, checking if three integers form a right triangle, calculating the remainder of division, and finding the Nth Fibonacci number.
